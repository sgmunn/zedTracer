# Kusto editing spike

Install this directory as a Zed dev extension, then open `examples/highlighting.kql`.
The extension recognizes `.kql` files and provides Tree-sitter highlighting.
It also launches a local language server for completion, hover information, and
syntax diagnostics. The server uses `Microsoft.Azure.Kusto.Language` 12.4.0 and
does not connect to a cluster.

Build and install the language server with the .NET 8 SDK:

```sh
./install-server.sh
```

Then run **Zed: Rebuild Dev Extension** in Zed. The language server binary is
installed in Zed's Kusto extension work directory. To use a different binary,
set `lsp.kusto-lsp.binary.path` in Zed settings. Restart the language server
after rebuilding it.

Completion includes Kusto keywords, built-in functions, and names declared in
the current query. Hover shows Kusto's quick information for supported symbols.
Diagnostics cover syntax only.

For offline table and column completion, put a `.kusto-schema.json` file in the
Zed project root and restart the language server:

```json
{
  "database": "Samples",
  "tables": {
    "StormEvents": {
      "State": "string",
      "StartTime": "datetime",
      "DamageProperty": "long"
    }
  }
}
```

Open `examples/offline-schema` as a Zed project to try the included snapshot
and query. The server reads the first workspace root at startup and reports an
invalid schema in the language server log. It does not connect to a cluster,
refresh schema files automatically, or validate table and column references.
Connecting a schema source and adding semantic diagnostics are later steps.

To run the language server protocol tests:

```sh
dotnet restore server/KustoLanguageServer.csproj --ignore-failed-sources
dotnet build server/KustoLanguageServer.csproj --no-restore
python3 server/test_server.py
```

The grammar is pinned to `Willem-J-an/tree-sitter-kusto` at the commit in
`extension.toml`. To run the fixture check, install the `tree-sitter` CLI, clone
that grammar, and run:

```sh
./test-highlighting.sh /path/to/tree-sitter-kusto
```

The grammar has incomplete coverage of Kusto, so complex or newer query forms
may parse with errors and lose some
highlighting. Grammar coverage and cluster schema integration need evaluation
before shipping this as default language support.
